# How to present KPI metrics

1. Metric Cards: Start by including metric cards prominently in your dashboard. Metric cards provide a clear and concise display of your KPI values. Each card should show the current value of the KPI, as well as a comparison to a target or previous period. You can use different colors or icons to indicate positive or negative trends.
2. Trend Analysis: Add line charts or area charts to visualize the trends of your KPIs over time. These charts help to identify patterns, seasonality, or overall performance trends. Plotting the KPI values on a timeline can provide insights into whether the metrics are improving, declining, or remaining stable.
3. Comparative Analysis: Use bar or column charts to compare the performance of different metrics or different time periods. Side-by-side visualizations can help identify correlations or disparities between KPIs. For example, you can compare the revenue and expenses for different products or regions.
4. Goal Progress: Consider adding gauges or bullet charts to show the progress towards predefined targets or goals. These visualizations provide a clear representation of whether a KPI is meeting its objectives. Include thresholds or benchmarks to indicate whether the KPI is above or below the target.
5. Drill-through Functionality: Implement drill-through functionality to allow users to access more detailed information behind each KPI. Users can click on a specific KPI or chart element to view underlying data, such as transactional details or supporting metrics. This helps in understanding the factors influencing the KPIs and identifying potential areas for improvement.
6. Contextual Information: Include additional context and supporting data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the KPIs. This can include key highlights, summaries, or explanatory text to help users interpret the metrics and their implications. Incorporate relevant visuals, such as maps or images, if applicable to your data.


# Data Storytealing Techniques


Creating a good data storytelling dashboard involves designing a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that effectively communicates insights and tells a compelling story with data. Here are some key points to consider when creating a data storytelling dashboard:

1. Define your audience: Identify who your audience is and what information they need to make decisions. This will help you tailor your dashboard to their specific needs and interests.
2. Determine your key message: Decide what message you want to convey with your dashboard. This will help you structure your dashboard and choose the most appropriate visualizations.
3. Choose your visualizations: Select visualizations that effectively communicate your message and insights. Use a variety of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, tables, and maps, to provide different perspectives on the data.
4. Make it interactive: Include interactive features, such as filters, slicers, and drill-throughs, to enable users to explore the data and discover insights on their own.
5. Tell a story: Use narrative techniques, such as headlines, annotations, and callouts, to guide users through the data and tell a story that is engaging and memorable.

Different types of data storytelling include:

1. Descriptive storytelling: This involves describing the data and providing insights that help the audience understand what is happening.
2. Diagnostic storytelling: This involves analyzing the data to determine why something is happening and what factors are contributing to the outcome.
3. Predictive storytelling: This involves using the data to make predictions about future outcomes.
4. Prescriptive storytelling: This involves using the data to recommend actions that should be taken based on the insights provided.
5. Exploratory storytelling: This involves providing a tool for users to explore the data and discover insights on their own.
