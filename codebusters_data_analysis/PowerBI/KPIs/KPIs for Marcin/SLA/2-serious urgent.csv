I think this should not be an incident request.
As there is no wrong configuration. 

We would need to clarify who should be responsible to remember or request that this kind of update is necessary.;;;","11/Apr/23 2:58 PM;ssanz;Hi [~mstaszek] , I put IR because it was a IR case from TUI and I put the CI for all other customer in SR (CI-8459). We know that this must happen every year at this time. Can't we add several periods until for example 2035 ?. BR, Sandra
