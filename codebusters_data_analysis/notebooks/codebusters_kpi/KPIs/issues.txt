The flow:

Check ho many days is in jia
Check time spend in each od the subtask, sum if needed and compare


Fixed:

441934 - ticket was reopen, main tickets needs to be updated. Do I have check which validates if there is a newst resolved date and the same for create date if it use the first one


456393 - missing data about indivicual taksks

Still wrong:

https://jira.ifao.net/browse/CI-8021 the time in statutus information is not updated (Jira issue)

438429 - not data about "import to customer test system" even though data sets were dowladed from jira yesterday
